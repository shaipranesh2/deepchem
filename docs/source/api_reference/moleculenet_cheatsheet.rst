MoleculeNet Cheatsheet
----------------------
When training a model or performing a benchmark, the user needs specific datasets.
However, at the beginning, this search can be exhaustive and confusing. The
following cheatsheet is aimed at helping DeepChem users identify more easily which
dataset to use depending on their purposes.

Each row reprents a dataset where a brief description is given. Also, the columns
represents the type of the data; depending on molecule properties, images or
materials and how many data points they have. Each dataset is referenced with a
link of the paper. Finally, there are some entries that need further information.
