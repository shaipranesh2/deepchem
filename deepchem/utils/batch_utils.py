    """Computes the values for different Feature on given batch.
    It works as a helper function to coulomb matrix.

    This function takes in a batch of Molecules represented as Coulomb Matrix.

    It proceeds as follows:

    - It calculates the Number of atoms per molecule by counting all the non zero elements(numbers) of every\
    molecule layer in matrix in one dimension.

    - The Gaussian distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the Cartesian coordinates of two atoms.\
    The distance value is then passed through a Gaussian function, which transforms it into a continuous value.

    - Then using number of atom per molecule, calculates the atomic charge by looping over the molecule layer in the Coulomb matrix\
    and takes the `2.4` root of the diagonal of `2X` of each molecule layer. `Undoing the Equation of coulomb matrix.`

    - Atom_membership is assigned as a commomn repeating integers for all the atoms for a specific molecule.

    - Distance Membership encodes spatial information, assigning closer values to atoms that are in that specific molecule.\
    All initial Distances are added a start value to them which are unique to each molecule.

    Models Used in:

    * DTNN

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_b: np.ndarray
        It is a 3d Matrix containing information of each the atom's ionic interaction with other atoms in the molecule.
    distance_min: float (default -1)
        minimum distance of atom pairs (in Angstrom)
    distance_max: float (default = 18)
        maximum distance of atom pairs (in Angstrom)
    n_distance: int (default 100)
        granularity of distance matrix
        step size will be (distance_max-distance_min)/n_distance

    Returns
    -------
    atom_number: np.ndarray
        Atom numbers are assigned to each atom based on their atomic properties.
        The atomic numbers are derived from the periodic table of elements.
        For example, hydrogen -> 1, carbon -> 6, and oxygen -> 8.
    gaussian_dist: np.ndarray
        Gaussian distance refers to the method of representing the pairwise distances between atoms in a molecule using Gaussian functions.
        The Gaussian distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the Cartesian coordinates of two atoms.
        The distance value is then passed through a Gaussian function, which transforms it into a continuous value.
    atom_mem: np.ndarray
        Atom membership refers to the binary representation of whether an atom belongs to a specific group or property within a molecule.
        It allows the model to incorporate domain-specific information and enhance its understanding of the molecule's properties and interactions.
    dist_mem_i: np.ndarray
        Distance membership i are utilized to encode spatial information and capture the influence of atom distances on the properties and interactions within a molecule.
        The inner membership function assigns higher values to atoms that are closer to the atoms' interaction region, thereby emphasizing the impact of nearby atoms.
    dist_mem_j: np.ndarray
        It captures the long-range effects and influences between atoms that are not in direct proximity but still contribute to the overall molecular properties.
        Distance membership j are utilized to encode spatial information and capture the influence of atom distances on the properties and interactions outside a molecule.
        The outer membership function assigns higher values to atoms that are farther to the atoms' interaction region, thereby emphasizing the impact of farther atoms.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import os
    >>> import deepchem as dc
    >>> current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    >>> dataset_file = os.path.join(current_dir, 'test/assets/qm9_mini.sdf')
    >>> TASKS = ["alpha", "homo"]
    >>> loader = dc.data.SDFLoader(tasks=TASKS,
    ...                            featurizer=dc.feat.CoulombMatrix(29),
    ...                            sanitize=True)
    >>> data = loader.create_dataset(dataset_file, shard_size=100)
    >>> inputs = dc.utils.batch_utils.batch_coulomb_matrix_features(data.X)
